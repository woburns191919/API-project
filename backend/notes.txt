npm install && npm run build && npm run sequelize --prefix backend db:seed:undo:all && npm run sequelize --prefix backend db:migrate:undo:all && npm run sequelize --prefix backend db:migrate && npm run sequelize --prefix backend db:seed:all




1) roll back seed files
2) roll back migrations
3) db migrate (remigrate)
4) db seed (reseed)


in package json
"dbreset":
npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:undo:all && npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate:undo:all && npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate && npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all



Delete render every time make new seed?

Rollback command?

Math on agg functions?

I made a minor change to a seeder file. Render was not happy. Is there a better way-- rather than deleting the postgress instance entirely--to resolve this render build error?


include username with spot from id--this okay?


1) I'm currently working on 'Get all reviews of the current user for Air bnb,' and when I try to hit /reviews/current, the info from /spots/current pops up. This could be from eager loading the data in spots/current (which works in production--it would be great not to have to change this).

2) I'm currently working on 'Add an image to a spot basesd on the spot's id' for Air bnb, and when hit  a spot that doesn't exist (i.e. /spots/20/images), I'm getting a foreign key constraint error but am expecting a 404. Any ideas why this could be happening?





1) Get Current User: authentication: true, how to log out
2) Edit a spot--accepting invalid body info
3) delete spot--how to check if authenticated user, how to check if owner is owner of spot


Delete User--authorization check


authentication current user vs null?



  errors: { credential: 'Please provide a valid email or username.' } vs  "credential": "Email or username is required"
  on Log In User error response
